Located in the heart of South Africa's Northern Cape region, **SteamNet 2000** embodies the spirit and heritage of steam railways. Our base of operations is in Kimberley, a city with a rich history tied closely to the railways that once served as the lifelines of the region.

## Our Mission

SteamNet 2000 is a dedicated club with a passion for restoring steam locomotives to their former glory. We aim to:

- **Preserve the legacy** of steam railways in the Northern Cape.
- **Boost tourism** in Kimberley by showcasing the beauty and heritage of steam locomotion.
- **Engage the community** in our restoration projects and educational programs.

We believe that by bringing steam back to life, we can offer a unique glimpse into the past, while contributing to the future of Kimberley and its surroundings.
